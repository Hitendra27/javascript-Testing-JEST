## Testing is one of those things that people either love or hate. Usually testing is something that is hated, until you work on a project with good tests and you realize how amazing they are. In this video I am going to show you how to get started with testing in JavaScript using Jest. I will talk about the code you need in order to write tests, as well as show you some pitfalls of testing. I will breakdown the importance of testing and some best practices you can adhere to in order to make your tests amazing.
